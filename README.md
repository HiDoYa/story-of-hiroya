# Story of Hiroya

## What is this?
This is the very first project I wrote with Javascript in 2015. All the original code is in `original.js` and was written in Processing.js in Khan Academy's text editor. The code is pretty terrible and impossible to read so I unobfuscated it just so I can actually run it locally.

I'm save this file in Git just for archiving purposes. 

## Original Purpose
This is a game/slideshow to describe who I am.
